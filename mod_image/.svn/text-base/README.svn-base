mod_v8 is an experiment in integrating the v8 javascript engine within the 
Apache HTTP Server.

To use:
  AddHandler v8-script .v8

And write a .v8 file with your script.

mod_v8 currently exposes a global 'ap' object, with the following functions:
  ap.log: Logs a message to the apache error log.
  ap.write: Writes a string to the client.
